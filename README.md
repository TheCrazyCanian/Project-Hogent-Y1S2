# Project-Hogent-Y1S2

The following folders, files and lines of code were written for a group project I had in the second semester of the first year of Applied Information Technology: System and Network administration at Hogent. It was not only written by me, but by 2 other colleagues of mine as well. the main code can be found in the folder: "Rummikub_G12" and then "src"
